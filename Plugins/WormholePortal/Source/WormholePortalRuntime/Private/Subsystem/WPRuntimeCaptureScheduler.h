/**
 * Owns Portal Pair capture scheduling for one World.
 *
 * This is a Game Thread-only, non-UObject type. UWPRuntimeSubsystem creates and
 * destroys it, and it holds
 * non-owning references to the supplied Manager and Pair Map. The Scheduler must
 * therefore have a shorter
 * lifetime than RuntimeSubsystem and CaptureManager.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - 0/1/2-Endpoint visibility policy driven by Renderer visibility feedback
 * - CPU line traces to eight SafeProxy ring points per Endpoint and camera-inside
 *   exclusive Pair selection
 * - Endpoint target-Hz and A/B staggered-cadence calculation
 * - Capture-authority warmup/recovery and CaptureManager submission
 *
 * Non-responsibilities:
 * - Pair creation and removal decided by the Registry
 * - RenderHandle ownership handshake and RenderPacket publication
 * - Actual ownership of Cubemap/LUT UObject resources
 *
 * Terms:
 * - Visibility: whether a Portal Endpoint was a screen-compositing candidate in the
 *   final Render Frame's
 *   View Frustum. The Game Thread reads Renderer feedback in the next Callback, so this
 *   is not an immediate
 *   result for the current Frame. It is the latest completed-Frame result whose
 *   Ownership Epoch and Packet
 *   Sequence have been validated.
 * - Occlusion: an additional conservative CPU line-trace test for a Portal that is
 *   inside the Frustum but
 *   completely hidden by walls or opaque geometry. Any open ring point keeps the
 *   Endpoint visible, avoiding
 *   false suspension.
 * - Cadence: accumulated time that determines the interval between Cubemap Endpoint
 *   captures. At a target
 *   rate of 30 Hz, each Endpoint interval is 33.333 ms and the alternating A/B Callback
 *   interval is half that.
 * - Submission: requesting actual capture render work from UWPCaptureManager. The
 *   Scheduler selects timing
 *   and A/B scope; the Manager creates and destroys Render Targets and Components.
 * - Authority: the state and Epoch contract under which the Runtime Manager, rather
 *   than an Actor, may
 *   execute capture for the Pair. Authority transitions to RuntimeOnly after warmup
 *   succeeds; repeated
 *   failures trigger Manager-state recovery.
 *
 * Typical single-Frame sequence:
 * 1. UWPRuntimeSubsystem::Tick selects one Reference Camera Snapshot.
 * 2. UpdateVisibilityAndOcclusion updates the camera-inside exclusive Pair and
 *    CPU-occlusion state.
 * 3. After Actor Movement, RunCaptureScheduler evaluates the same Pair Map from
 *    OnWorldPostActorTick.
 * 4. Visibility 2 keeps A/B compositing and capture active. Visibility 1 composites
 *    only the visible side
 *    while continuing to update both Cubemaps. Visibility 0 or complete occlusion of
 *    both sides stops A/B
 *    capture after the hold period.
 * 5. While stopped, the VRAM-first resolution policy may release the current large
 *    Cubemaps and retain only
 *    the 64 tier. Replacement allocation is serialized and release-first; the Wormhole
 *    may disappear while
 *    RenderPublication drops old references and the asynchronous resources become ready.
 *
 * If the Camera is inside a SafeProxy, only that Pair is updated and all other Pairs
 * stop. When SafeProxies
 * overlap, the Pair with the smallest deterministic PairId-based Sort Key is selected
 * so results do not vary
 * between runs. An ambiguous Reference View or Feedback state fails open to favor
 * visual correctness over
 * performance.
